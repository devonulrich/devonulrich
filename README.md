### Hi, I'm Devon!

- 🎓 I am currently a junior in Princeton's [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/).
- 📚 Some of my favorite classes so far include:
  - COS 429: Computer Vision
  - COS 343: Algorithms for Computational Biology
  - COS 451: Computational Geometry
- ⌨️ In the past, I was a Software Engineering intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/) and the [Maloof Research Group](https://maloof.princeton.edu/).
    This summer, I will be doing Software Engineering at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/us/).
- 💻 On campus, I previously worked as a [Lab TA](https://labta.cs.princeton.edu/) for COS 226: Algorithms and Data Structures and COS 217:
    Intro to Programming Systems. Currently, I am a grader for COS 340/240: Reasoning about Computation.
- 🎺 In my free time, I enjoy playing the trumpet in the [Princeton University Orchestra](https://orchestra.princeton.edu/), and also design and maintain the 
    Orchestra's website. I am also a co-lead developer for [HackPrinceton](https://www.hackprinceton.com/). I also love to go rock climbing!
